I attended the 2020 Spring session of Insight Data Science NYC, a 7 week long,
postdoctoral professional development fellowship from January through March.
I had a lot of fun doing it, but it was also surreal to watch the world shift
under our feet in early March during the outbreak of COVID-19.

There is this theory in cosmology that the quantum field that permeates our
universe is only metastable. There exists a lower energy stable point than the
one we currently occupy. At some point in time, a place in the universe might

part of the universe in the true vacuum state would then expand symmetrically
at the speed of light, destroying everything it touched. It's one of the ways
our [universe may end](https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/vacuum-decay-ultimate-catastrophe/).

In March, it was as if a section of NYC found its true vacuum, one that
travelled along the Raritan Valley Line at the 70 mph, leaving unspeakable
destruction in its wake. But of course, just like
