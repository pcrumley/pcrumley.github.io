Hi. I'm Patrick. Right now I work as a [computational
astrophysicist](https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/patrick-crumley), but I
am also in the middle of a career transition. I am starting a blog to find ways
to connect in this new normal, write down my thoughts, and document things about
my work in and outside of academia that I'm proud of or think might help others.

I'm choosing to call my blog *Voorwerpjes*, which is a Dutch word that
translates into 'little things'. But it is also the name of the class of the
astronomical object pictured below, [Hanny's
Voorwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanny%27s_Voorwerp). Voorwerpjes are
echoes of supermassive black holes, an anomalous astronomical object discovered by
a citizen scientist in the Netherlands, Hanny van Arkel. She was volunteering as
part of the [Galaxy
Zoo](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/) project when
she saw something new. It turned out to be a
whole class of objects no one had seen before.

Galaxy Zoo is a wonderful project that has lots volunteers who donate their time to
categorize hundreds of thousands of galaxies based on their shape. It always
gives me a fuzzy feeling to think about---the project combines the best parts of big 
data and technology; using the internet to build community and collaboration between
experts and non-experts.

I hope to fill up this space with little things.
