title: "About Me"

I have ~10 years of experience performing advanced analytics and building tools in languages
such as Python, Rust, C++, and JavaScript. I have developed a unique analytical approach to software 
development, with a deep understanding of the mathematics undergirding new data science,
machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques.

For my next adventure, I am seeking roles at the intersection of data science
and software engineering.

Curious about the name *Voorwerpjes*? See [this post](/blog/hello-there)
